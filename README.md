# CUSTOMISED ADVERTISING PROJECT (CITYBIKE)

This is my final Bootcamp project with [IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/us/en/data-analytics), the objective is to analyze all the bike trips with the CityBike app in New York City, to know **WHO** and **HOW** they use them and to be able to make personalized advertising campaigns.

##Project Description & Project goals

The project consists of two parts:

#### Part 1

The objective of the first part of the project is to carry out personalized advertising campaigns in each Community District of the city of New York.

For this, all trips made in New York City with the CityBike app in 2022 will be analyzed, which are available on the [Citybike website](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).

Through the use of ETL techniques, the bike stations available to CityBike (of which we only have the coordinates) are located in each Community District, adding data on the distance traveled on each trip, travel time and all relevant information for our analysis.

Subsequently, the data from the New York City census is used, which is available on the [US census website](https://www.census.gov/data.html), is then used to analyze the type of people living in each Community District.

From the analysis of all the above data, we can know who uses the bike in each district and how, in order to carry out personalized advertising campaigns in each one of them.

#### Part 2

The objective of the second part of the project is to carry out advertising or information campaigns for users, by segmenting all trips made in New York City in 2022 by similar characteristics.

For this, Machine Learning algorithms have been used, which group all trips into clusters, which can be used to later send text messages to all users of each cluster, promoting the use of the bike through the application of discounts or promotions personalized.
